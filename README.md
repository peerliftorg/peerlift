Peerlift is a web application where students find quality scholarships for college in a fast and intuitive interface.  
It's built as a React application with an Express.JS backend and noSQL database, and deployed with Heroku.

So far, Peerlift has logged 110,000+ vists and remains an actively used application by high school students across the US. 

As of January 11, 2022, I've open-sourced Peerlift's codebase and welcome contributors. 


## Contributing
I've transitioned to a maintenance role, but will actively review PRs and issues.  I welcome those who may be interested in contributing in a larger capacity. 
Begin by opening a PR or sending an email to sgorman@stanford.edu.  Parts of the codebase may be less clear or less documented as I initially wrote this as a solo project two years ago.
However, as time permits I plan on refactoring, and happy to answer any questions related to the codebase.  Thank you!
